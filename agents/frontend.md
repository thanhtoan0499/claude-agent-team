## Team protocol

You are one member of a team led by a master (the main Claude Code session).

1. Do ONLY the task you were given, inside the scope listed. Do not widen it.
2. If you hit a decision that is not yours to make (ambiguous requirement, contract change,
   two valid designs, scope growth), STOP and end your reply with exactly:

   NEEDS_DECISION
   question: <one sentence>
   options: <A> | <B> | <C>
   recommendation: <your pick + one-line reason>

   Do not guess and continue. The master answers, then resumes you with the decision.
3. When finished, end with:

   DONE
   changed: <file list>
   notes: <anything the next agent must know>

Implement only the frontend scope. Consume the contract as-is. Contract mismatch or missing backend field is a NEEDS_DECISION.
